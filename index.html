            <p class="content">
                A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee
                is generally safe within usual levels of intake and is more
                likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at
                doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee daily. Exceptions include
                possible increased risk in women having bone fractures,
                and a possible increased risk in pregnant women of fetal
                loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated
                by poor study quality, and differences in age, gender,
                health status, and serving size.

                Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on
                coffee trees from a genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species
                of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs to trees.

                    <b>Type of bean.</b>
                    There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica originates from
                    Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide.
                    However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment,
                    requiring shade, humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit.
                    The Robusta coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and
                    survives in a wider range of temperatures between 65 - 97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also
                    withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in rainfall and strong sunlight.

                <li>
                    <b>Type of roast.</b>
                    Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce a chemical change
                    that releases the rich aroma and flavor associate with coffee. They are then cooled and
                    ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter the
                    roast, lighter the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity and a bitter
                    roasted flavor. The popular french roast is medium-dark
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Type of grind.</b>
                    A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee makers. A fine
                    grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso, releases the oils, and a coarse grind
                    is used in coffee presses.
